A token is a single component in a programming language. The five categories of tokens are:

1. Constants,

2. Identifiers (names that uniquely identify a program element in the code – such as variables),

3. Operators (such as +, * or -),

4. Separators (also called “delimiters – a sequence of one or more characters that specifies the boundaries of sections of code),

5. Reserved words (words that have set meanings and uses, and cannot be redefined by a developer).

Sometimes in Dev Tools, if there’s an error in your code, it may state: Unexpected token – which means there’s a component in your code the browser can’t execute.

JavaScript keywords are tokens that have special meanings. As discussed previously, keywords are reserved words in JavaScript which means you cannot use them to name variables or functions.
